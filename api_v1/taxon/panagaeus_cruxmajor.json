It is clearly an elusive species but also appears to be subject to large fluctuations in population size at sites where repeated surveys have been undertaken. This species was formerly more widespread and has clearly declined in both area and extent of range; this is apparent in the data despite more intensive targeted recording effort in the post-1980 period. There is no reason to think that the decline is not continuing (B2b i,ii,iv).",
