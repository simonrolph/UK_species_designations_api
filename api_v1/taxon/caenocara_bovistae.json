But the lack of known plausible threats means that neither B2 nor D2 apply, although this is due to lack of information rather than known lack of threat. Plausible threats cannot be fully assessed at present without close examination of the condition of the remaining known sites. The Extent of Occurrence has declined severely over the past 100 years but there is no data on change in the past 25 or 10 years. Area of Occupancy is certainly currently highly fragmented, with just four locations known, but there is no evidence available concerning decline in modern times. Near Threatened is therefore suggested as the current status using IUCN criteria.",
