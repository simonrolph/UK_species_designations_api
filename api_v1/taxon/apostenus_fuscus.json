Dungeness has been extensively damaged by gravel extraction, causing significant alteration to the hydrology, and thereby ecology, of the area. There are currently plans for a new nuclear power station and a large airport expansion while away from the conservation areas the extension of holiday centres and other recreational activities may lead to damage, notably by motor cycles and other vehicles crossing the shingle, vegetation and ridges. However, there is evidence that the shingle communities are capable of regenerating after superficial disturbance, hence low levels of surface disturbance may be biologically sustainable.",
