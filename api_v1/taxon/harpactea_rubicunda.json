It was found in numbers in the Tilbury area of Essex, but there were no further records until it was rediscovered at the same location in 2005. The site is under threat from natural succession and prone to damage from human activities. Threats: Since 2005 the chalk quarry where the spider is recorded has been under Essex Wildlife Trust ownership and management and the location and needs of the spider are known to the Trust, but the breezeblock debris is becoming covered in scrub and there has been quite extensive planting of saplings and scrub in nearby parts of the quarry as part of 'landscaping' associated with the massive Chafford Hundred housing development that took place between the 1990s and 2005.  It is uncertain whether Hambler & Linfield recorded the species at other sites in the area, or where these were, but virtually all the brownfield land in the Tilbury area is either already lost to development or will be developed in the near future.",
