That only three further specimens have been found suggests that this is a species that occurs at low density, with a tenuously established British population. Water margin habitats at Dungeness are vulnerable to uncontrolled fluctuations in water levels, to rapid succession, and to invasion by Crassula helmsii (Kirk) Cockayne. In the longer term, the cessation of aggregates extraction at Dungeness will end the supply of newly excavated, bare pit margins, though the RSPB is developing management techniques to maintain early-successional conditions on pit margins (D2).",
