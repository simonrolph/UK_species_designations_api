It has not been seen in Britain since 30th August 1996 despite targeted search effort by the author and others at at least four of the five post-1980 localities. This species has declined in AOO throughout the 20th century and that decline appears to have continued into the post-1980 period (B2b i,ii,iv). Comprehensive targeted surveys are required to establish whether this species still persists in Britain.",
