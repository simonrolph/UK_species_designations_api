Owen proposed that this species might in fact be an established synanthropic alien, since it has almost exclusively been recorded from artificial habitats - also only urban sites. Widespread in south of England (Denton, 1996); from Kent to Cornwall (Owen, 1999). May be more widespread than current records suggest due to its subterranean habits (Denton, 1997). May well be spreading (Mann & Angus, 2002).",
