The reasons for the historical decline are not clear, but there have been similar apparent declines in other species which feed on dry carrion such as Nitidula species (pers obs.). The practice of improved hygiene on grazed sites (i.e. requirement to remove dead animals) and the decline of the use of Keeper's Gibbets may have contributed in some way. Very probably under recorded, with no known targeted survey for the species and for these reasons, a designation of Near Threatened only, is advised.",
