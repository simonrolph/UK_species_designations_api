Under-recording is not considered a major factor because although adults are most frequently found in winter, they are also found in spring and early summer and their favoured habitats are also generally well surveyed. The species is threatened by the loss of old beech woods, deep litter and moss in semi-natural woodland and old grasslands. Threats: The loss of old beech woods. This species has been found in litter in pine plantations, but under pine is more often in clumps of moss mixed with litter than in pure pine litter, and therefore is usually more frequent in semi-natural woodland.",
