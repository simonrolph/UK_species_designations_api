The population is severely fragmented and continuing decline is both observed (lost from the New Forest and Exeter in the SW, and from Dunham Park and Long Eaton in the north) and projected: the availability of suitable host trees is diminishing with intensive agriculture continuing to cause decline and death of old trees (especially severe at the Forthampton location), old trees continued to be removed for tidiness reasons (in parklands and wood pastures), and new generations of suitable trees are not being established in sufficient numbers.",
