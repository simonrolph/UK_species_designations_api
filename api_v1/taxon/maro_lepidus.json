The main threats are peat extraction, drainage and afforestation. Commercial peat-cutting has destroyed most of the major peat-mosses in north-west England and degraded the remainder. Rusland Moss is drying out, pine is invading, and there are further drainage proposals along one side of the surviving bog.",
