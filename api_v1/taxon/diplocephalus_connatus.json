The habitat is vulnerable to river engineering work but only one of the hectads with previous records has been surveyed in recent times; it may still persist in the other locations. Threats: No immediate threats are known, but the habitat would be vulnerable to river engineering work. Survey work to clarify its continued presence is urgently required.",
