            "designation_description": "A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

Very similar to M. minutissima and may have been overlooked in the past - or could be a recent colonist (Brooke & Nau 2003). It is certainly more common than records suggest as, according to B. Nau, it is present in a high proportion of rivers sites checked in Bedfordshire and surrounding counties (pers. comm.). If a recent colonist then status of NA may be appropriate (see K.Alexander, 2014) but if an overlooked native DD would be the best assessment. It is likely, however, that even if M. griseola is a recent colonist this represents a natural extension of range and, as in the case of Sigara iactans, it should be regarded as 'native'.  A status of DD is considered  appropriate.",
