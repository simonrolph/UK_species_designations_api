As it is found in ants’ nests, it may be under-recorded, hence the assignment of VU rather than EN. Threats: The tidying up of fallen limbs and branches from ancient trees poses a threat to those invertebrates associated with this habitat. In addition, the pressure resulting from increased recreational use of sites such as Charnwood and Sherwood Forests may lead to conservation problems in the future. There may be increased demand for space and more stringent health and safety requirements call for dangerous trees, which may be liable to shed branches, to be made safe or removed altogether. In Charnwood Forest, quarrying and bracken burning threaten habitats where the spider has been recorded.",
