Hectad counts alone show a 60% decline since 1990, and the occurrence of the species on individual mosses probably shows higher losses. The current area of acid mire in the two blocks occupied is far smaller than 100km2. The few recent records all fall within the same small area. The acid mire habitat  in this area was historically diminished as a result of coniferisation and drainage, leaving isolated patches that are scarce and vulnerable, though more recent plans are aimed at peat soil restoration. Populations of Atylotus plebeius  remain extremely vulnerable to effects due to isolation as corridors between habitat patches do not exist. A status of Endangered reflects the scarcity of lowland basin mire, the tiny range and the delicate nature of bogs, although the few records give no indication of recent decline; the species may possibly have always been very rare and restricted in Britain.",
