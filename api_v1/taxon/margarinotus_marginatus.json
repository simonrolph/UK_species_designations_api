            "comments": "The reduction in hectads in the main and later count periods infers that this species has declined historically and is also undergoing current ongoing decline, but it is important to factor in the habitat of the species in underground mammal nests and runs and the fact that few present-day Coleopterists investigate mole fortresses or deep litter in rabbit burrows. For this reason, the species is undoubtedly under-recorded and is likely to be much more widespread and frequent than the data suggests. Because the ongoing decline appears to be linear (but is probably assuming this pattern completely randomly), IUCN Category A2 criteria were applied. Using a 23% decline measured over the 30-year period 1986-2015, the application gave an adjusted 10-year decline of 8% which is well below the 30+% threshold required for IUCN Vulnerable. 101 records.",
