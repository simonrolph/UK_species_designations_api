Historical decline inferred from 62% reduction in hectads (AoO) between the two main date ranges, though no recent decline proven as there have been no targeted surveys to rediscover the species at former locations. A trend of increase in recorded hectads between the later date periods may be partially due to increased survey effort by one recorder in south-west England, but the hectad count post-1990 is high enough to remove this species from the IUCN Vulnerable category where it was placed in the provisional assessment. Some of its current sites are protected. The species may be particularly sensitive to improvements in pasture and the use of endectocides in addition to the general threat of grazing regime changes resulting in reduced dung availability.",
