Site condition monitoring by SNH in 2011 confirmed its continued presence in the Flanders Moss area. Despite seemingly healthy populations at the small number of known sites, it remains vulnerable to pressures such as hydrological changes, wild-fires and scrub encroachment. Threats: Changes to the hydrological regime of bogs due to erosion or forestry are potential threats. With only four raised bog sites for this species it is vulnerable to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period.",
