On ERS habitats in Wales it appears to be stable. At coastal localities in England it has declined historically but is perhaps now stable. It has been overlooked in Cornwall and this may be true elsewhere in England (Alexander and Gainey, 2009). With records from only 8 widely-scattered hectads in the post-1980 period, this species could move into a Threatened category quite quickly.",
