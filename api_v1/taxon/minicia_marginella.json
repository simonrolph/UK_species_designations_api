A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

            "comments": "Previously thought to be confined to a small area next to the Channel Tunnel, where it was discovered in 1987 and refound in 1991, it was discovered at Butterburn Flow SSSI, Cumbria, in 2015. Little is known about this species, so given its very restricted distribution it is given a precautionary VU status.  Threats: The species was discovered during an extensive invertebrate survey of several sites around Dover and Folkestone as part of a study of the ecological impact of the engineering work for the Channel Tunnel. It is not known how the construction of the Channel Tunnel has affected the population of this species. If the species is restricted to such a small, rather vulnerable area it must be under considerable threat. The main threat to the site itself may, in the long term, be sea level rise and increased wave action. However it is quite possible that it occurs in the rough grassland and scrub which occurs between Aycliffe and the cliff tops.",
