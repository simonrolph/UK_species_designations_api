Possibly extinct indicates that there is a small chance that the taxon may still be extant, and hence  should not be listed as Extinct until local or unconfirmed reports have been discounted, and adequate surveys have failed to find any individuals.",

A population size estimate of zero individuals can be made with reasonable confidence (D). However, given that it appears to have remained undetected in the New Forest until 1969, there is a possibility that it may be recorded again in Britain.",
