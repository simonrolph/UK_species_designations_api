IUCN criteria satisfied are based on the very small or restricted population: geographic range restricted in area of occupancy (less than 1 tetrad) with severely fragmented populations (only two reports in past 25 years). No sub-fossil remains have yet been found in Britain (Buckland & Buckland, 2006), but current understanding suggests a long-term native.",
