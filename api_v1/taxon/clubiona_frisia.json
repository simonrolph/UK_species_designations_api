Threats: Public pressure can cause damage to the fragile dune vegetation, destroying it by too much trampling or by climbing in the steeper dunes. Possibly holiday development has destroyed some habitat, and this is always a threat to coastal dunes which lack statutory protection. Sand dunes are popular sites for golf courses (Sandwich Dunes now supports three) and the associated buildings, roads and re-profiling and reseeding of the dunes cause damage to the natural ecosystem. Several sites where it occurs, such as Minsmere, are nature reserves. Sea level rise is a potential future threat to existing sites.",
