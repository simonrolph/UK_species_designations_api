            "comments": "Last recorded in the region from East Sussex in 1988 on the South Downs. Some 27 years have elapsed since this discovery, but the species has been found in 2016 (outside of the scope of this Review) in the West Midlands region. The 1988 Sussex site is a chalk downland escarpment, in its entirety covering more than 10 square kilometres. The quantity of suitable grazed habitat within the landscape here is not currently known but is likely to be less than 10 square kilometres. The site is regularly monitored for butterfly transects, so it is on the radar and accessible. Continuing decline is strongly inferred from the data. This coupled with suitable habitat (location) size below 10 square kilometres and no records of the species in the region for over 25 years, qualifies for IUCN Category CR B2a,b. Threats include the use of endectocides  and continuity of dung through changed livestock practices and grazing regimes.",
