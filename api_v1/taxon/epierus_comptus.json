Considered by some to be a possible introduction, but for the purposes of this Review, the species is treated as a long-overlooked native. There is no evidence of decline and to the contrary, the discovery of new sites in recent years suggests a possible increase although data is limited. There are also no plausible threats to the species at present. With an AoO of 12km2 and a presence in only 3 locations since 1990, the species nearly qualifies for Endangered under B2a. However, as there is no evidence of decline (b) or extreme fluctuations (c), it affords a Near Threatened category instead. 14 records.",
