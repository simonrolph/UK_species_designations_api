            "comments": "Recorded from only three locations since 1993, but appears to be well-established at these sites. This species’ AOO appears to have halved, from six hectads before 1993 to just three since, but it may still persist at Sandwich, Kent, where it was last found in 1992. Although apparently formerly numerous at all three sites, at Colne Point, Essex, extensive fieldwork in the early 1990s and in 2004 located only males, in very small numbers, despite the use of pitfall trapping. Threats: Public recreation can easily destroy the fragile vegetation of dunes and shingle. Outside nature reserves, this habitat is often the site of developments such as golf courses, caravan parks and chalets. Golf courses at Sandwich Dunes with their associated roads, buildings, drains, re-profiling and reseeding, have caused some damage to this fine dune system.",
