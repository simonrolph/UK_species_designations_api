The main loss has been from England where there was previously site-specific evidence of physical damage to the habitat and eutrophication. Climate warming may be affecting its range. Threats: Much of Glasson Moss has been commercially cut for peat, a practice which ceased in the 1950s. There have been a series of fires on this bog, the most recent and most serious being in 1976. There are signs that eutrophication of Biglands Bog is occurring. This may be due to run-off from the heavily fertilised pasture and arable land which surrounds it, or from Bampton Beck, or both. Bampton Beck crosses the site and carries the outflow of a sewage works. It occasionally floods the bog.",
