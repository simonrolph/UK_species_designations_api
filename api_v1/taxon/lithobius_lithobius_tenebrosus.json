            "designation_description": "A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

Two pre-1970 records from other locations should be considered doubtful due to possible misidentification of Lithobius macilentus (Eason, 1964). Combination of difficulty of collecting centipedes from rock crevices and possibility of misidentification may have resulted in under recording of the animal.",
