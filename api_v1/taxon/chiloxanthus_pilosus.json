This could be an artefact of under-recording although other saldid species found in coastal habitats, including saltmarshes, have been recorded since 1989 from many areas outside these two regions and, as shore bugs go, C. pilosus is a relatively conspicuous species. C. pilosus has not been recorded in Wales since 1946 (Howe 2004). It is a very local species on the western limit of its range in GB and does not fall far short of a threat status. On the basis of AOO (<2,000km2) and projected risk to saltmarsh habitats it is assessed as NT.",
