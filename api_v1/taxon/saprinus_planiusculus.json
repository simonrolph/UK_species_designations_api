The author believes that it is under-recorded and evidence of its continued existence should be sought at recent former haunts and 'new' coastal sites. Despite a mere 16 post-1990 hectads, a designation of Nationally Scarce only, is considered to be an accurate reflection of its probable current status. It falls short of qualifying for IUCN status and the data quality is not of sufficiently high standard to apply IUCN criteria. 67 records.",
