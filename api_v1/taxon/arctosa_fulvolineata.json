Threats: In the construction and maintenance of sea defences, the strip of land immediately in front of the sea wall is very vulnerable to being covered with spoil or at best severely disturbed. The spider's adoption of this habitat at Colne Point would suggest that the sea wall has caused a seaward contraction of its horizontal range on the shore. There has been extensive work to raise sea wall defences at this and other parts of coastal Essex, and suitable habitat for this spider may have been lost. Sea level rise and coastal defence improvement are likely to increasingly threaten this and other coastal species.",
