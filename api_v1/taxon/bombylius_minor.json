While the population appears to be stable, it has a low density and may be highly localised on the heaths. However, it shows no marked decline (given the level of recording effort) in the number of occupied hectads.  A rather small proportion of hectads in common before and after 1990  suggests that recording has still to cover all its likely terrain in the Dorset heaths. These Dorset heaths have contracted in area considerably and are still under threat from development. The status may need revising upwards if its population in the Dorset heaths continues to be eroded.",
