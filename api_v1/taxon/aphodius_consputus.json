            "comments": "Since 1990, almost entirely restricted to the south-eastern tip of England. The species is however likely to be under recorded, partly because it is winter-active, when less fieldwork is undertaken and partly because Coleopterists have returned to 'known localities' in search of specimens rather than surveying for the species at new sites. It is difficult to prove continuing decline under such circumstances, although this is suspected, at least in certain parts of its range. This species is particularly susceptible to reduction of dung availability as a result of winter shedding of livestock. An additional threat is the widespread application of endectocides.",
