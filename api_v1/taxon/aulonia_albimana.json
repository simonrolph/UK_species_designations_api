Threats: The quarry near Dunster from which it was recorded in the 1960s and 1970s has been used as a rubbish tip, a common fate of disused quarries. The site of the earlier records has also apparently been destroyed. The site on the Isle of Wight is on military land with restricted access, so there is no immediate threat to the existence of the overall site. The exact location there has become scrubbed over and shaded, but there is still suitable habitat close by (Wright 2008).",
