It covers all species in these groups, identifying those that are rare and/or under threat as well as non-threatened and non-native species.",

            "designation_description": "A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

            "comments": "The data collation only found records from seven hectads since 1990. It is very difficult to know if this is an accurate representation of its true status, or whether the species is just being ignored by naturalists, being dismissed as ‘museum beetle’ irrespective of the true identity of the pest species concerned. It is no longer the commonest pest in museum collections.",
