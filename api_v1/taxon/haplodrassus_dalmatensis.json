This applies to species listed as Least Concern which are declining but relatively widely distributed and do not qualify under Near Threatened but has the potential to qualify for Near Threatened in the future if their decline is not understood and/or ameliorated. While strict criteria for inclusion in an Amber List have not been standardised between taxa or agreed otherwise, this status has been allocated to species that have undergone substantial declines between the pre- and post-1993 periods but which remain widespread. Species have been included in this list where biases in recording effort are thought unlikely to be the only cause of the perceived decline, or where the cause of the decline may be unknown. It can also be considered a ëwatch listí for species where further survey work is required to confirm under-recording bias or otherwise.",
