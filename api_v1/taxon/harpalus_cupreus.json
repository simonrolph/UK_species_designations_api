Possibly extinct indicates that there is a small chance that the taxon may still be extant, and hence  should not be listed as Extinct until local or unconfirmed reports have been discounted, and adequate surveys have failed to find any individuals.",

Nevertheless, the author is not aware of any targeted attempt having been made to rediscover this species on the Isle of Wight, and the possibility remains that the absence of records since 1914 reflects an absence of survey effort.",
