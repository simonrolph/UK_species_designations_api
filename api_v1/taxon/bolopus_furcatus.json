The wide scatter of recent records suggests that this species is under-recorded and would be expected to turn up in more sites. Moved beyond NS under Criteria 2 & 8, in recognition of the ubiquity of the fungal species host, which  attacks various species of broadleaved trees including Ulmus, Acer esp. Sycamore, Fagus, Fraxinus, Tilia and Aesculus",
