A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

Consequently, although the species is considered likely to be highly localised in distribution, the current situation is one where data is insufficient to evaluate its true regional status. 3 records.",
