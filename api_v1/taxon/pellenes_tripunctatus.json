However, shingle habitats are prone to damage by leisure and commercial activities, and exceptional tidal and wave conditions. Threats: The Crumbles was largely destroyed in 1988 by marina and building developments. Dungeness has being extensively damaged by gravel extraction, which is causing significant alteration of the hydrology, and thereby ecology, in addition to the obvious loss of shingle area to gravel-pits. There are also plans for a new power station at Dungeness. Irrevocable damage has been caused by motor cycles and other vehicles crossing the shingle, damaging the vegetation and the shingle ridges. This damage has largely been reduced to the occasional incident and there is evidence that the shingle communities are capable of regenerating after superficial disturbance.",
