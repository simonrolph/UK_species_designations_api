The reason cannot be that it is more difficult to find than many other Stratiomyidae since the difficulty would have been similar at all times. The current small number of hectads (5) coupled with this decline suggest that it status should be Endangered. This marks a considerable upgrading in status from Nationally Scarce (Falk, 1991); the species was not mentioned in Shirt (1987).",
