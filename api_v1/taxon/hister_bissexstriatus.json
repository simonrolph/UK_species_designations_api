In common with many species of the dung-feeding Scarabaeidae, the invertebrate prey of Hister bissexstriatus may be susceptible to livestock endectocide treatments. The beetle itself may be adversely affected by pasture 'improvement' management practices and to changes in grazing regimes which might impact negatively on dung-availability. Consequently, it is vulnerable in the broadest sense, but not to the degree of qualifying currently for IUCN status, although it may be a candidate in future reviews. 46 records.",
