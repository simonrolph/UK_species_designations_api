Sea levels around Essex are rising relative to the land by some 6mm a year, a combination of the land sinking and sea level rising as a result of global warming. This is causing erosion of saltmarshes and at the present rate most of the habitat will have been lost within a few decades. Many of the Thames Marshes have been reclaimed for industrial development, with the extensive use of vertical concrete-capped iron pilings along the waterfront leaving very little saltmarsh. With the abandonment of older industrial sites next to the Thames, there is now enormous pressure from initiatives such as the 'Thames Gateway' to redevelop, often for high value riverside housing. It seems unlikely that the importance of small areas of fragile saltmarsh will be adequately taken into account.",
