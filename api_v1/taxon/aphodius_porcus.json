There is an approximately 60% decline in recorded hectads in the main date period and one of approximately 25% in the second date period (1984-2015). The species may be very sensitive to pasture improvement and the use of endectocides. It may be under recorded due to it being in the field as an adult in late autumn and its supposed habit of burrowing into Geotrupes burrows as well as remaining in the dung above ground as an adult. With more than 11 locations since 1990, but strongly inferred decline, the species is designated NT.",
