The species may exist at low populations and thus be difficult to detect, but it appears nonetheless, that it is critically localised and perhaps currently only present at a handful of sites in southern England. Historical decline is evident from the data with a reduction of around 70% in occupied hectads between the two recording period in the main date ranges and further decline in the last 32 year period of 25% between the two 16-year date ranges. Thus, continuing decline is inferred from the data. The species is on the northern edge of its European range with us and can be abundant in warm southern European climates (pers obs.). Future warming trends in the British climate may favour this species.",
