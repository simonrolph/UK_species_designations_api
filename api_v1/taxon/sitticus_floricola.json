Threats: Wybunbury Moss suffered severe eutrophication for many years prior to 1986 owing to pollution from a septic tank and road drainage. Agricultural run-off still threatens further damage of this sort. The eutrophication has caused marked changes in the vegetation, with loss of Sphagnum lawn. There has been further loss of Sphagnum owing to birch and pine invasion. Woodland encroachment is also a problem at Abbots Moss, Delamere Forest.",
