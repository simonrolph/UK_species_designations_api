There is no obvious decline although with so few historical records this cannot be put into context well. The extent of its coastal Chalk habitat is small, perhaps 10-20km in total, so small changes to the condition of the habitat may make some populations vulnerable to extinction. Despite the wide geographic range, a status of Vulnerable is more appropriate than Near Threatened. If more inland populations on the Chalk are found, the status may need downgrading.",
