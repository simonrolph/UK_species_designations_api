Within this restricted AOO the extent and quality of its Sphagnum bog habitat has suffered decline, but is now apparently improving under conservation management. Threats: Wybunbury Moss suffered severe pollution from septic tank overflow and road drainage for many years up to 1986. This nutrient enrichment has had a marked effect on the vegetation and is causing the deep peat to degrade. Much of the former Sphagnum lawn has developed into fen. Eutrophication from agricultural run-off still threatens further damage. Further substantial areas of the nutrient-poor raft have developed into pine and birch woodland, aided by previous drainage attempts.",
