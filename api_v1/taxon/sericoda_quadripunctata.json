A substantial decline in AOO is apparent from the earlier decades of the twentieth century, and it is also apparent that this species is prone to extreme fluctuations in geographic range, having been extremely rare in the nineteenth century. It is possible that British records of S. quadripunctata may partly relate to long-range dispersers from the continent, though as it is also a rare species in its continental European range, there is little chance that further immigration to Britain will lift the species from its Critically Endangered status.",
