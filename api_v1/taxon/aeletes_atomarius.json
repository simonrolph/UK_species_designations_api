Due to its small size, this species is likely to be under-recorded. Its apparent increase in the region, demonstrated by a more than doubling of hectad counts in the main recording period is probably due to increased recorder effort at pasture woodland and parkland sites coupled with an increase in the popularity of extraction techniques such as the use of Tullgren Funnels. It is clearly more widespread and frequent than previously believed (cf Hyman, 1992). 75 records.",
