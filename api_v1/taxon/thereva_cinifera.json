It has been confused with similar species of both these habitats so, although it is undoubtedly rare, it may not be threatened. It has been recorded from only five hectads since 1990 but the few records may reflect its recent addition to the British list. A status of Near Threatened seems appropriate, although this may be too conservative and a higher threat category may be considered in future.",
