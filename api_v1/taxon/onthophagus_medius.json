For example, the vice-counties of Surrey and Middlesex supported the species in 8 hectads in the first recording period and none in the second – the last record being from 1989. Ongoing decline in terms of range contraction is suspected but difficult to prove throughout its range and under recording is likely. The species is susceptible to a range of plausible threats including change in land use and development, the use of endectocides and changes in grazing regimes and practices, affecting the availability and continuity of a dung supply. Whilst IUCN Categories do not apply, the species is close to a regional designation of Near Threatened.",
