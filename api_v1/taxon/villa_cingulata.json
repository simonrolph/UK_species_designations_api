Only one recent hectad duplicates an old record, suggesting that the species has moved into new terrain. Although it is population is undergoing a significant expansion in range and strength, it is still in two small areas compared to a much wider previous range. It may well fluctuate as it has in the past. Its apparent requirement for neither short-grazed nor long rank grassland makes it susceptible to changes in pastoral practice, and a run of cool wet summers may damage the population of this thermophilic species.",
