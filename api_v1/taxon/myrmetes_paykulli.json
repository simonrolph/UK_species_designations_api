The reasons for this decline are unknown, but wood ant (Formica rufa) has certainly died out at former sites in central England and Forestry operations and woodland clearance may have contributed to the decline. However, there is no evidence that this decline is ongoing as the recent 30-year period hectad counts show. The species is also highly likely to be under-recorded in forested tracts of Scotland, so the post-1990 hectad count of 15 is possibly a gross under-representation of the true extent of the population across the region. For these reasons, the species falls short of qualifying for IUCN status. The status of Nationally Scarce is maintained, rather than upgraded, based on the assumption that the species is more widespread than current records suggest. 80 records.",
