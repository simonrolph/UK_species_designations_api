There have been two recent discoveries in unremarkable arable farmland away from its care range in Breckland, at Benington, South Lincolnshire (TF3846) on 9th August 2005, and in Cambridgeshire (TL36) in August 2013. These records suggest that H. froelichii may be expanding its range, and certainly that it may be more widespread and less of a habitat specialist than previously thought. However, it remains a rare species which was recently estimated to have only three certainly viable British populations (Telfer, 2009).",
