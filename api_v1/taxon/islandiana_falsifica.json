This report was commissioned to update the national threat status of Araneae using IUCN methodology for assessing threat. It covers all species of Arachnids in Great Britain, identifying those that are rare and/or under threat as well as non-threatened and non-native species.",

A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",
