Three males and two females were taken from litter in an area of over-mature coppice chestnut in 1967, one female in 1971 and two males and a female from litter of a five-year-old chestnut coppice in 2004. Changes in woodland management at its known sites pose a threat. Threats: There has been a large decline in the area of coppiced chestnut woodland in south-east England over the past 60 years. The British site is in a National Nature Reserve and there are several other protected sites in the Blean Woods complex to the north of Canterbury in which this species might also occur. However with such an apparently small population and restricted occupancy, the species must be prone to the effects of human activities and stochastic events. Changes in woodland management at its known sites pose a threat.",
