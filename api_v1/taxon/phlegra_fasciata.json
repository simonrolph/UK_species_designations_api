Threats: Erosion caused by high public use, particularly the use of motor vehicles on shingle, and possibly holiday development threaten the rather fragile habitats of this species. Dungeness has been extensively damaged by gravel extraction, which has causing significant alteration of the hydrology, and thereby ecology, in addition to the obvious loss of shingle area to gravel-pits. There are plans for a new power station at Dungeness.",
