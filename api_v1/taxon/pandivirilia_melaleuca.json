There is no indication of decline, but rather the newly found Gloucestershire and Worcestershire sites suggest that it may be more widespread. It still has a very small area of occupancy that is defined by the presence of ancient trees. Its available habitat is therefore very restricted and highly vulnerable. In view of the recent confirmation of populations in western England, a status of Near Threatened, rather than Vulnerable, is appropriate, although the species is clearly still a rare insect.",
