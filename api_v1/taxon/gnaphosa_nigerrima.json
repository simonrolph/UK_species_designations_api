Threats: Wybunbury Moss has suffered from attempts to drain the site for development and this has caused drying out of the peat. Natural England and volunteers have been involved with maintaining the moss since the 1980's.  However the population appears to be small and must be vulnerable to stochastic events within a short time period.",
