Most records are from mature oak trees in open woodland habitat, at the edge of clearings or in hedgerows, often stressed by drought, nutrient deficiency or root damage. This type of habitat is threatened by lack of management resulting in the closure of open woodland, or by the loss of old trees. Where old oak trees occur on land converted to arable or old hedgerows are adjacent to arable fields, the spider is also threatened by the use of pesticides on adjacent crops.",
