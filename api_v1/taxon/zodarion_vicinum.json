Threats: The species was discovered during an extensive invertebrate survey of several sites around Dover and Folkestone as part of a study of the ecological impact of some aspects of the engineering work for the Channel Tunnel. It is not known how the construction of the Channel Tunnel has affected the population of this species. The main threat to the site itself may, in the long term, be sea level rise and increased wave action. Since Zodarion species prefer hot dry habitats, another threat may be revegetation of areas of bare ground.",
