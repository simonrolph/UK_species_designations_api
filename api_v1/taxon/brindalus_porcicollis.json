The beetle appears to be restricted (within the whole expanse of beach) to a tiny patch and is at very low abundance such that it can be very difficult to find and record (pers obs.). A designation of CR B2a,b is advised based on a projected decline in the area of occupancy due to the site having no protection from destruction by human activities and by its area of occupancy being significantly less than 10km squared.",
