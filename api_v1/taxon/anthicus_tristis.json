The same situation presumably applies at other historic sites. However recent confirmation has only come from the Chesil/Portland/Weymouth area. IUCN criteria satisfied are based on the very small or restricted population: geographic range restricted in area of occupancy (less than 1 tetrad) with severely fragmented populations (currently known from 2 localities, although perhaps the same continuous site).",
