A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

Threats: If old chalk grassland is important in the ecology of this species, it is likely to have suffered great loss of habitat in recent decades, as it is estimated that over 70% of chalk grassland was destroyed in Britain between 1940 and 1984 (Nature Conservancy Council 1984). Much of this loss has been the result of conversion to arable agriculture. The Royston field is now under cultivation.",
