Larvae develop in terrestrial fungi, especially species of the genus Agaricus, including field mushrooms, and Macrolepiota species (parasol mushrooms), with occasional records from Calvatia, Boletus and Russula species. Due to its association with field mushrooms, it will have suffered from grassland habitat loss, collection, and sward mowing, but will also have been under-recorded because of its different habitat from other Platypezidae. Moved beyond NS under Criteria 2, 7 & 8.",
