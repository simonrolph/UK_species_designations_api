Possibly extinct indicates that there is a small chance that the taxon may still be extant, and hence  should not be listed as Extinct until local or unconfirmed reports have been discounted, and adequate surveys have failed to find any individuals.",

Attempts have been made to rediscover it at the Lyndhurst site, but to date these have been unsuccessful, despite the continuation of grazing here (pers obs.). The reasons for its decline are not understood, but habitat fragmentation, dung availability and the use of endectocides are possibly contributory factors. Collecting may also have taken its toll.",
