A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

Although 4 post 1989 records (hectads) would place this species in the IUCN Endangered category it is almost certainly far more widespread than records suggest. Without a concerted sampling effort within its known range any assessment will be difficult. Assessed as  DD.",
