It satisfies Endangered B2a in having only 2 hectads in the recent period, and B2b ii & iv with records falling from 10 hectads to only two in the second time period, with attendant declines in both area of occupancy and number of locations. Under D2 it satisfies Vulnerable for locations (each record clearly is a separate location in IUCN terms) but it is impossible to understand what the plausible future threat driving it to CR or EX would be. Subsequent reviews should help clarify whether this decline is real or an artefact of recording effort, though the species has, historically, seemingly only ever been rare although with a wide geographic range.",
