The contiguous English populations of Dorset and Hampshire have remained relatively stable and show no real sign of contraction in range, as indicated by the high proportion of old and recent hectads in common. The widely spaced Scottish records suggest that there may be a large, if scattered, population at the south-west end of the Southern Uplands. It appears that there is no immediate threat to the British populations but clearly they are very Localised and at a low density so susceptible to regional extinction. In view of the stability of the English population and likelihood of a moderate population in Scotland, its status has been downgraded from the previous status of Endangered to Least Concern. Moved beyond NR under Criterion 7.",
