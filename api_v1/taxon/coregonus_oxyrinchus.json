The principal aims of the Convention are to ensure conservation and protection of wild plant and animal species and their natural habitats (listed in Appendices I and II of the Convention), to increase cooperation between contracting parties, and to ensure the protection of certain fauna species (listed in Appendix 3) imposing regulations on any exploitation. To this end the Convention imposes legal obligations on contracting parties, protecting over 500 wild plant species and more than 1000 wild animal species.",

This is the means by which the Community meets its obligations as a signatory of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention). The provisions of the Directive requires Member States to introduce a range of measures including the protection of species listed in the Annexes; to undertake surveillance of habitats and species and produce a report every six years on the implementation of the Directive. The 169 habitats listed in Annex I of the Directive and the 623 species listed in Annex II, are to be protected by means of a network of sites. Each Member State is required to prepare and propose a national list of sites, which will be evaluated in order to form a European network of Sites of Community Importance (SCIs). These will eventually be designated by Member States as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and along with Special Protection Areas (SPAs) classified under the EC Birds Directive, form a network of protected areas known as Natura 2000.",
