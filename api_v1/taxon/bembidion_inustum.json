A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

There are no obvious threats to the known localities, nor to the habitat in general. Perhaps the main threat to this species is ignorance of its distribution, habitat and ecology; without further information, no conservation action can be taken.",
