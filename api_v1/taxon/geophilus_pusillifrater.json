            "designation_description": "A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

The animal is probably under recorded due to the difficulty of collecting small centipedes from coastal shingle and rock crevices. Based on current knowledge of its distribution, any surviving population in Britain is of global importance.",
