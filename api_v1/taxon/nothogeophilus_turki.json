Intensive survey work in recent years (Lee et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012) failed to locate surviving populations on the IOW. There have been no searches on the Isles of Scilly in recent years and there is no reason to suppose that the species no longer survives there. However, the loss of the IOW colonies represents a significant decline in  AoO which now stand at less than 500 sq. km hence the geographical threshold for EN criterion B2 is met. The animal is believed to exist at less than 5 locations and there have been significant declines in EoO, AoO and the number of locations between the two recording periods despite the intensity of recording effort. Therefore the IUCN criteria for the Endangered category are satisfied.",
