It is still known from only two sites and has undergone extreme fluctuations in abundance, being unrecorded between 1934 and 2011. The distribution is clearly fragmented. From the limited number of New Forest records with site names, the species appears to have been recorded from the same small area in which mire occupies far less than 30km2; the area of the entire suite of Oxfordshire fen SSSI around Cothill and Dry Sandford (which may be unsuitable) amounts to less than 2km2. Given the apparently precise nature of the species’ preferred habitat, the area of occupancy is likely to be less than 10km2.",
