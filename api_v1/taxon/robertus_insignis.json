A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

Because so little is known of the microhabitat requirements and ecology of this species, the exact nature of threats to it remain unclear. In the Broadland area of East Norfolk, sedge-beds have suffered considerable degradation since the beginning of the last century resulting from eutrophication of waterways, water abstraction, land drainage and abandonment of traditional mowing of fen vegetation which in turn leads to scrub and carr woodland encroachment. Which, if any, of these threats have impacted R. insignis populations is unknown.",
