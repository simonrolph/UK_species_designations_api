The decline appears to be ongoing which is cause for concern, but the species may be under recorded and the decline is not quite significant enough to designate the species as Near Threatened at this time, hence a status of 'Amber'. Statistically, the number of recorded hectads have decreased by 72% in the main period and by over 40% in the 1984-2015 period.",
