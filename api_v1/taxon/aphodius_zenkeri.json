            "comments": "This species with records from less than 100 hectads since 31st December 1989, would normally qualify as Nationally Scarce (NS), but the authors believe that it is under-recorded and is likely to be present currently in more than 100 hectads of the National grid . Some decline is possibly indicated in the north of its range, although this may be due to under recording. The species is likely to be under recorded because it favours wooded habitats which are generally harder to work for dung-feeding species than open habitats (pers obs). For this reason and for the fact that it has been recorded from 62 hectads since 1990, its GB Rarity status has been downgraded. A contributory factor towards its stability in our region may be due to its association with deer dung. Deer have not only increased in recent years, and particularly in many Midlands districts (pers obs.), but their dung is unlikely to be affected directly by the use of endectocides.",
