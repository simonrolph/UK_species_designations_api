This system is designed to determine the relative risk of extinction, and the main purpose of the IUCN Red List is to catalogue and highlight those taxa that are facing a higher risk of global extinction (i.e. those listed as Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable). The IUCN Red List also includes information on taxa that are categorized as Extinct or Extinct in the Wild; on taxa that cannot be evaluated because of insufficient information (i.e. are Data Deficient); and on taxa that are either close to meeting the threatened thresholds or that would be threatened were it not for an ongoing taxon-specific conservation programme (i.e. are Near Threatened).",

Within this project, the remit of the present report is to assess the status of Odonata throughout Great Britain, using the updated IUCN Red Data Book criteria and categories. The previous assessment of the conservation status of British Odonata using IUCN criteria and categories is in Shirt, 1987. This lists four species as Endangered, two as Vulnerable and three as Rare. Three of the Endangered species were regarded as extinct in Britain.",
