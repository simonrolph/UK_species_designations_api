The species has only been recorded from 5 post-1990 locations. There are plausible threats, the most immediate of which is availability and continuity of dung. The use of endectocides is also likely to negatively impact the dung-frequenting prey of this beetle. Land use changes and pasture improvements may also be detrimental to its survival. On coastal sites, an additional threat comes from tidal events which may destroy habitat. Due to these factors, an IUCN designation of VUD2 is appropriate. 23 records.",
