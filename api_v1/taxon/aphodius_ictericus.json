For example, it  was recorded from 19 TQ/TR/TV hectads in south-east England before 1990 and only 10 since 1990. This 48% reduction in hectads is reflected, albeit less markedly, in the National trend as seen from the main period hectad count. In the second period (1984-2015), the decline appears to have halted with the number of hectads in each 16-year period being of similar magnitude. Any declines in the south-east appear to have been offset in this recent period by new populations discovered in the East Anglian Brecks up into north-west Norfolk and also in Berkshire. No perceived specific threat.",
