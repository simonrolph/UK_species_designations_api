It shows not obvious decline but there are no recent records from the west of its range in England, so its range may have contracted slightly. Only one hectad has records before and after 1990 so it may be well underrecorded. Its close resemblance to R. tringarius may lead it to be dismissed in the field as this common species and so will not often be closely examined. While R. annulatus is technically on the verge of being Vulnerable, more careful recording may show it to be more widespread.",
