The decline is continuing, with further sudden losses since 1980, including from large sites under conservation management. Monitoring work on the population at Frainslake Sands, reported by Gibbs (2008) shows annual counts varying from 314 to 17 adults, suggesting that this species also undergoes extreme fluctuations that place each population at risk of local extinction (B2c iv). With an estimated British AOO of 48 km2 (substantially less than 500 km2), this is an Endangered species.",
