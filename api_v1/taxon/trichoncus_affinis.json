Dungeness has been damaged by gravel extraction and there are plans for a new power station at Dungeness. Irrevocable damage has been caused by motor cycles and other vehicles crossing the shingle, damaging the vegetation and the shingle ridges. This damage has largely been reduced to the occasional incident and there is evidence that the shingle communities are capable of regenerating after superficial disturbance.",
