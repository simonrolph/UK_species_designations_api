Though rare and local, and having apparently undergone a major decline, recent work suggests a degree of under-recording, hence CR is not thought justified. Threats: The planting of conifers at Bagley Wood will almost certainly have reduced the amount of suitable habitat for this spider. It is not clear whether the introduction of short rotation coppice at Brasenose Wood has adversely affected the species at this site.",
