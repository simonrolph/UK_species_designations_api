There are also historic records from Wales, Dorset, Yorkshire, Cheshire and Suffolk, but these locations no longer support populations and may never have done so. Since 1980 the species has formed several new colonies in Surrey and Bedfordshire, which are probably the result of horticultural introductions and two further colonies have been reported from coastal sites in Sussex and Kent, the origin of which is less clear. There are several reports from inland locations which refer to isolated imports. All colonies are fairly localised and since macropterous individuals have never been observed in Britain, the insect must have poor powers of dispersal here.",
