            "comments": "A number of specimens were collected on the coast of Kent before the mid 1800s, perhaps up to 1869, most on the Deal and Sandwich dune systems (e.g. eight specimens in that area in July 1815 (Allen, 1967)). There is also a report of one (an adventive?) captured at St Leonard's, Sussex in 1902. The species occurs on the coast in France, Holland and Belgium, so all old records in England may have resulted from chance immigration. If this is not the case and Allen (1967) produced a convincing argument that it was not immigrants that were collected in the 1800s but representatives of an indigenous Kent coast population, then any indigenous population is certainly extinct, as this is a large and distinctive species that would not have gone unrecorded for over 100 years otherwise.",
