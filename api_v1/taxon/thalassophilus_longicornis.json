Though it is near to the 'Number of locations' threshold for Vulnerable (B2a), it is presumed still to be a somewhat under-recorded species. It could be declining but data are too poor to judge trends. Its ERS habitat could very well make it subject to severe fragmentation and extreme fluctuations.",
