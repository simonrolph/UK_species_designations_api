The key period of decline appears to have been pre-1990; however, the data does suggest a continuing and significant reduction in the AoO. The species is currently extremely thinly scattered within the former range (7 locations), and continuing decline is projected in (i) extent of occurrence, (ii) area of occupancy, and (iv) number of locations, all combining to indicate Vulnerable under criterion B. None of the recent records have been within the last 10 years although this probably reflects under-recording.",
