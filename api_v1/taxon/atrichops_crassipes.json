The apparently large decline of 70% since 1990 may be due to several records being of larvae recorded in a period of greater aquatic sampling activity in the 1980s; since such records have not been collected more recently, the real distribution is probably closer to that given by all relatively recent hectads (15 hectads since 1980, eight before 1980). Atrichops was considered exceptionally rare earlier in the 20th century, and it may have become more frequent in the last 30 years. Moved beyond NR, invoking Criterion 7 & 2",
