A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

However, there are few reliably identified species, making the data impossible to interpret. The species may be Near Threatened or under greater threat, as there are no records since the publication in 2001 of Stubbs & Drake.",
