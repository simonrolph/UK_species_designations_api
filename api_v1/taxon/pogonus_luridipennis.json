The dynamic nature of the coastal habitat occupied by this species means that some of these localities are probably no longer suitable for the beetle and the true area of occupancy in any one year may be substantially smaller. There have been substantial losses in range over the past century and there is evidence for more recent losses on the Norfolk coast, hence this is regarded as a species in continuing decline (B2b i,ii,iv). P. luridipennis depends in the long-term on dynamic coastal processes to some extent to regenerate new saline lagoon habitat but it is also vulnerable in the short-term to catastrophic coastal flooding and erosion. At the time of writing, the east coast of England has recently been subject to extraordinary flooding and erosion as a result of the tidal surge of December 2013. Whether P. luridipennis maintains a sufficiently robust meta-population in Norfolk and Lincolnshire to survive such an event and to colonise any suitable habitat newly created is highly uncertain.",
