In fact, the species has been 'discovered' at several sites in recent years after a long absence of records. The 1989 discovery at Dungeness, East Kent, was the first recorded in Britain since 1952. However, with only four post-1990 locations and plausible threats in the form of events such as tidal surges, flooding, coastal land use changes and developments such as flood defence barriers and industrial complexes, an IUCN designation of VUD2 is appropriate. 57 records.",
