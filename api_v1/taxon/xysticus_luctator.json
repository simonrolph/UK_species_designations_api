Threats: The grazing pressure, particularly from ponies, is too high in much of the New Forest for mature heath to develop. This is despite the fact that current grazing levels are much below that allowed by the bye-laws. However, in the long term a more serious threat is posed by the decline of grazing as interest wanes in exercising the commoners' rights to graze livestock on the Forest. A marked lessening of the grazing pressure would allow scrub encroachment on the areas of heath. Bloxworth Heath has been largely lost to conifer forestry, only a small part of the original surviving as Morden Bog NNR.",
