A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

            "comments": "This inconspicuous species, found in soil crevices and tunnels, has been recorded at only two locations since 1993. Its apparently substantial decline is likely to result from difficulty of detection. It appears to have been regularly found at a few sites so collection method is probably important. The loss of grassland to scrub or agricultural improvement may be a threat to this species. Threats: Conversion of calcareous grassland to arable agriculture or the scrubbing-over of sites if grazing lapses.",
