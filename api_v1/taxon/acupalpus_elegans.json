Possibly extinct indicates that there is a small chance that the taxon may still be extant, and hence  should not be listed as Extinct until local or unconfirmed reports have been discounted, and adequate surveys have failed to find any individuals.",

The intensification of survey effort on brackish/saline lagoon margins since the addition of Anisodactylus poeciloides to the list of Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Species in 1994 has yielded many entomological discoveries but no records of A. elegans, and the chances of this species surviving unnoticed in Britain are very small.",
