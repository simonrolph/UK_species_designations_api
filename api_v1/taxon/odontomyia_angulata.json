The sites are exclusively fen or similarly habitat of high quality, probably related to high and constant levels of ground-water and high water quality. Within each of the sites or cluster of sites, the species is clearly very rare, even though apparently suitable habitat exists in nearby areas. The habitat requirement is therefore much more specific than just fen or pool margins. The sites are also low-lying so there may be a climatic limitation. A status of Vulnerable is therefore appropriate even though there are several extant populations.",
