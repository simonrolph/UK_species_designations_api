It has certainly undergone a decline in range (both AOO and EOO) over preceding decades and there is no reason to think that that decline is not continuing to the present day (B2b i,ii,iv). Our understanding of the distribution, habitat and ecology of B. distinctus in Britain remains somewhat clouded by identification uncertainties. This account has taken a fairly cautious approach to judging records but may still be partially based on erroneous records. It is hoped that Endangered status will provide a spur to coleopterists to resolve those uncertainties.",
