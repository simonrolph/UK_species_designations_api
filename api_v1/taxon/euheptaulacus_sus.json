Its main stronghold is at Northam Burrows NR in North Devon in an area of sheep and horse-grazed coastal grassland covering less than 2 square kilometres. The East Kent, Norfolk and Suffolk Breckland sites are smaller, comprising pasture grassland. With only four current (post-1990) locations in the region with a combined area of less than 20 square kilometres, but with the difficulty of proving recent continuing decline, its status is designated Vulnerable D2. Plausible threats include the use of endectocides to treat livestock and cessation of grazing resulting in discontinuity of a dung supply. The North Devon site has SSSI status. Whilst the site is protected, the dung supply is not.",
