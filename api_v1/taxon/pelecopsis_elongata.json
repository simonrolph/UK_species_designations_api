            "comments": "Although there is no evidence of decline in this species, it occurs in only a small number of Calrdonian pine forest sites and remains threatened by changes in woodland management. Threats: Areas of Caledonian pine forest are threatened with conversion to intensive forestry using Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis, lodgepole pine Pinus contorta and other alien species. The ecological requirements of P. elongata are not known in detail, but it is unlikely that conversion of open Caledonian pine forest to dense plantation forestry will maintain the habitat in a suitable state for this species. North of the Loch Garten RSPB reserve there has been a great deal of planting of Scots pine and lodgepole pine on land which previously supported scattered mature native pines. In Rothiemurchus Forest, 305 ha out of the 1539 ha of native pine were ploughed and planted in 1971 with Scots pine and lodgepole pine. Although 30 ha of Abernethy Forest were felled in 1984 before it was renotified as an SSSI, and a total of 226 ha were lost since 1977, it is now owned and managed by the RSPB.",
