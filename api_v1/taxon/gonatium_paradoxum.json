            "comments": "The species appears to be restricted to a small area of south-east England. It has been recorded from just one location since 1993 and the AOO has apparently declined very substantially. The spider occurs mainly on mature dry heathland and amongst moss and grass in chalk grassland. It is unlikely that enough suitable habitat remains to maintain viable populations where it occurred at Limpsfield and Crookhamhill Commons in Surrey, but it is thought likely to still be present at Box Hill, Surrey, and in the Ashdown Forest, East Sussex. Threats: Ashdown Forest is suffering bracken and scrub invasion because of lack of grazing, with only one of the commoners now exercising sheep-grazing rights. There are also frequent fires in some areas. Limpsfield and Crookhamhill Commons are both small and now heavily scrubbed over. It is unlikely that enough suitable habitat remains at these sites to maintain viable populations of this spider.",
