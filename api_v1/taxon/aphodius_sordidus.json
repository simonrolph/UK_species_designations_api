The loss from at least one and possibly both of its two recent Suffolk sites represents a 10-20% decrease in our region's currently known population. This loss is due to cessation of grazing and it shows how quickly land-use and grazing regime changes can impact the species. No satellite populations were identified nearby and the decline was noted casually rather than from targeted survey which suggests that other losses may be occurring elsewhere of equal significance.",
