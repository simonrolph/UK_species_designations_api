Despite searches at most of its historic (and other likely) sites it has not been rediscovered. It has probably been lost from its loch sites because of disturbance to the shoreline and loss of macrophytes by eutrophication (eg Loch Morlich). Threats: The species is possibly threatened by public pressure on beaches, disturbing the strandline. Its sand-dune/coastal habitat has become increasingly fragmented by development (eg agriculture and golf courses) and is under increasing pressure from recreation, eutrophication and coastal erosion. Most of the sites examined have had very little cast seaweed and this may be a significant factor even at protected sites such as Barry Links.",
