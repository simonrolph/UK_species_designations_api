This decline appears to be continuing with a further 33% reduction in hectads in the last 30 year period (1986-2015). The three consecutive 10 year period recording blocks suggest a trend that could be described as 'linear continuing decline'. Application of IUCN Category A2 criteria to this data gives a 10-year adjusted decline of only 13%, well below the 30+% threshold for Vulnerable. However, future reviews may find the species qualifying for IUCN Vulnerable. With only 43 post-1990 hectads and this history of decline, the species has been elevated to Nationally Scarce status. 263 records.",
