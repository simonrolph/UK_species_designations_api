The 19th and early 20th century population in the New Forest may have been a long-established native population, or perhaps a short-term established population following immigration or importation from the continent, but is long extinct â€“ last reported in 1905. The Dorking specimen (1957) was presumably either a vagrant or the result of an importation. Importation may seem unlikely for a species developing in old decayed wood but it is feasible that imported logs may include the accidental decayed log. A new colonization appears to be progressing into eastern England. No sub-fossil remains have yet been found in Britain (Buckland & Buckland, 2006).",
