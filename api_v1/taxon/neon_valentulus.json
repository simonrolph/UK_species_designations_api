            "comments": "Although this species has been reported regularly in the past at Wicken and Chippenham Fens, Cambridgeshire, and at Foulden Common, West Norfolk, the only recent records are from Roydon Fen, Diss, Norfolk, in 1990 and from Wicken Fen in 1999. There appears to have been a very serious decline in AOO. Threats: All the sites at which this spider has been recorded are either National or Local Nature Reserves and four (Wicken Fen, Pashford Poors Fen, Redgrave Fen and Foulden Common) are SSSIs. As with other fenland species, drainage of the East Anglian fens for agriculture has lowered the water table over a wide area. This, together with water abstraction for irrigation and public water supplies has decreased flows of water from springs on which many of the valley fens in the area depend. At many of these sites, drying out of soils has been accompanied by invasion of open fen communities by willow and birch scrub and, eventually conversion to carr woodland.",
