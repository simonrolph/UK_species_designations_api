Possibly extinct indicates that there is a small chance that the taxon may still be extant, and hence  should not be listed as Extinct until local or unconfirmed reports have been discounted, and adequate surveys have failed to find any individuals.",

Nevertheless, very little survey effort has been targeted at this species in the Portland vicinity since it was recognised as a British species, and this is a particularly neglected genus of British beetles; the possibility remains that this species could be rediscovered in Britain.",
