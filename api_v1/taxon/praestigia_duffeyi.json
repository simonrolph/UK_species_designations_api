Many of the Thames Marshes have been reclaimed for industrial development, with the extensive use of concrete-capped iron pilings along the waterfront leaving very little saltmarsh, and there is now enormous pressure to develop high-value riverside housing. Sea levels around Essex are rising relative to the land by some 6 mm a year, causing erosion of saltmarshes. At the present rate most of the habitat will have been lost within a few decades.",
