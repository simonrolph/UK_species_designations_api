Merritt, pers. comm.) and Cumbria in 2000 (Read, 2001). it is a breeding species in Ireland, but always occurs in low numbers (Brian Nelson pers. comm.). Low numbers in England may indicate under-recording but it is a conspicuous species and there is no evidence of a breeding population - probably an occasional immigrant.",
