Possibly extinct indicates that there is a small chance that the taxon may still be extant, and hence  should not be listed as Extinct until local or unconfirmed reports have been discounted, and adequate surveys have failed to find any individuals.",

            "comments": "This has always been a rare taxon in Britain with a highly restricted range.  Although the species possibly exists at low population density and hence may be difficult to detect, it has suffered a historical decline, has not been seen since 1995, currently has an AoO of only 8km squared or substantially less and only the one location in Britain. Despite the Ainsdale dune system being protected as a National Nature Reserve, it is the dung supply that is critical to the continued existence of this species. A winter grazing regime has recently been implemented at Ainsdale. This may alleviate any problems which could be caused by a lack of dung continuity, because it will boost the rabbit dung  resource and potentially act as a substitute should the rabbit population succumb to mxyomatosis outbreaks.",
