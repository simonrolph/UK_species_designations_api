It is nonetheless highly localised (though still widespread) and this geographically-fragmented population is possibly subject to continuing localised declines, although the lack of targeted searches in known haunts makes this difficult to prove. Also, hectad counts appear to be stable in the second recording period (1984-2015). With only 9 post-1990 hectads occupied and 8 since 2000, a designation of NT is advised.",
