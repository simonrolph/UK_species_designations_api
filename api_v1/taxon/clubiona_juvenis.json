Stanford Warren in Essex was denotified as an SSSI a number of years ago but is currently an Essex Wildlife Trust reserve, and Old Hall Marshes and Cliffe Pools (in Kent) are RSPB reserves, as is Sutton Fen in Norfolk. In the latter county the biggest threat to this species has been loss of reedbeds in recent years in the Broads, caused principally by eutrophication of waterways. The best areas of reedbeds are now those that are largely isolated from the main Broadland rivers. In areas where regular reed cutting has ceased, succession of reedbeds to carr woodland is also a major threat.",
