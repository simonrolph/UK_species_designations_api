Threats: The most significant threat is loss of open fens through drainage, the detrimental effect of lower water tables across large areas of East Anglia or invasion of scrub vegetation. A high proportion of the sites where this spider has been recorded are relict fen sites, with a long continuity of habitat. As with ancient forest, once lost or severely degraded there is no quick and easy means of restoration (Bob Merritt, pers. comm.).",
