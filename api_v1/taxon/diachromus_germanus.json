Following its rediscovery at Battle, East Sussex in 2002 (Woodcock et al., 2003) there have been at least four more localities discovered in East Kent, East Sussex and the Isle of Wight by 2013. Although a continuation of the current trend for expansion of EOO and AOO seems likely, there is a plausible threat of another extinction, as happened in the early 20th century (D2).",
