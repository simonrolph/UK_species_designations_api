The Cumbrian record was for for Solway Mosses (S. Hewitt in 1991 & 1993). There are two post 1989 records for Surrey (Denton 2007). Southwood & Leston (1959) considered M. marginalis to be  a shrinking species, now surviving precariously'. P. Kirby's comment: 'I've not seen it for years, and wonder whether a higher status might be justified, in view of its propensity to form small colonies and consequent sensitivity to habitat change'. The apparent decline in AOO in the period 1990 - 2013 may in part be due to additional records for the previous period obtained during Welsh Peatland Invertebrate Survey, but even if the species is still present in the few (3) Welsh sites the known AOO would still be small. The most northerly known site before 1991 was Thorne Moors in South Yorkshire where M. marginalis was recorded in 1980, but it hasn't been recorded there since, despite an extensive survey of the site in the 1990's (B. Eversham pers.comm.). The status of VU rather than EN is appropriate, despite the small known AOO (<500 km2) and sensitive heathland habitat, in view of probable under-recording.",
