At Thetford Warren Lodge it appears to have become much harder to find than when it was first discovered there and has not been recorded there since 2003; this probably indicates a decline at that site. However, this is clearly also an elusive species so there can be no certainty that it is undergoing continuing decline in range. It is nevertheless a threatened species, vulnerable to inappropriate land management and extrinsic factors such as nutrient deposition and climatic change (D2).",
