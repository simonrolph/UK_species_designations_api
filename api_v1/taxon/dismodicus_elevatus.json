Since 1993 it has been restricted to four hectads (three locations) in the western Cairngorms, with the most recent records from Abernethy Forest in 2013, where it was found to be common. It is possible that it is under-recorded at some of its former sites, hence downgraded from EN to VU, but it is of concern that its range appears to have contracted to this single area.  Threats: Potential threats include catastrophic damage to its habitat by such agencies as fire and recently introduced tree diseases potentially affecting both pine and juniper.",
