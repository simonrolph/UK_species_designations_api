Thorne Moors is the most southerly known recent site. There are large ares of potentially suitable but under-recorded habitat in Northern England and Scotland where it may occur. The extent of under-recording is impossible to assess accurately. There are 16 pre 1990 records in Yorkshire for T. pellucens but most of the sites have not been searched recently (R. Crossley pers. comm.). Despite quite extensive searching for saldids in the Scottish Highlands during the 1990's T. pellucens was only recorded once (S. Moran pers. comm.). In view of under-recording a status of DD may be appropriate if a more evidentiary, rather than precautionary, approach is taken. However, this is clearly an uncommon species that is hard to find and one that may have more specific, but at present unknown, habitat requirements. Air pollution, climate change, forestry and agriculture are all significant threats to upland bog habitats and a high percentage of monitored invertebrate species inupland habitats have declined (State of Nature report). With a recorded AOO of 7 tetrads (<30km2) a  status of NT is appropriate and conforms more closely to IUCN guidelines on the balance between evidentiary and precautionary approaches.",
