Possibly extinct indicates that there is a small chance that the taxon may still be extant, and hence  should not be listed as Extinct until local or unconfirmed reports have been discounted, and adequate surveys have failed to find any individuals.",

            "comments": "The species is probably extinct in Britain: a population size estimate of zero individuals can be made with reasonable confidence. Nevertheless, there is a chance that this species survives undetected somewhere on the coast of Britain. Allen and Nicholson (1924) noted “apparently it is exceedingly local, since we failed to find it in other places which appeared to us to be identical in character” and the very fact that it evaded discovery in Dorset until 1924 shows that this can be a difficult species to find. If C. nitidulus exhibits the same strongly nocturnal activity as its congeners, then torchlight survey of suitable habitat may be the best way to rediscover this species in Britain, though clearly the potential risks of nocturnal fieldwork on maritime cliffs make it unlikely that that theory will be tested.",
