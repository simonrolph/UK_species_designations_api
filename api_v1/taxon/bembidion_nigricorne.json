This has meant a positive Change Index (pre-/post-1970) and a large negative Raw%Change (pre-/post-1980) but both are biased by very uneven recording effort over time. Nevertheless, this could be a declining species. It meets the area requirements under criterion B2 for Endangered (AOO <500 km2) and Vulnerable (AOO <2,000 km2) and is near to the 'Number of locations' threshold for Vulnerable (B2a).",
