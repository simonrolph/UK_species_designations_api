The population at East Walton Common is stable and the fly has been recorded here over several years since its discovery in 1989, the first British occurrence. Adults have been found on tree foliage, mainly that of alder Alnus and sallow Salix, by small streams, a ditch and a sluggish river. Three sites are at the junction of wet peat and dry sand and this may be significant for the larvae, which are probably amphibious or even terrestrial, and may develop on wet or damp shaded peat (Stubbs, 1998).",
