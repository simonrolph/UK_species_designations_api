Despite its previous stronghold being in northern England, five of the recently found locations were in Wales and southern England. The main threats to this wetland and wooded valley species are likely to be land drainage and river engineering. Maintaining tree cover may be important at some locations. Threats: Drainage of wetlands for agriculture and forestry and engineering works on riverine channels are potential threats to this species.",
