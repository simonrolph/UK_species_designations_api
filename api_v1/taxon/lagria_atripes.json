It is difficult to find a reason why this beetle should have come and gone like that (Philp, 2002). It was apparently never seen again at Blean, after 1948. The only New Forest records were those of 1936 and 1938. It seems likely that the species colonized southern England from the near Continent temporarily and then became extinct.",
