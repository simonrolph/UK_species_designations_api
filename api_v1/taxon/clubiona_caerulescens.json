However, the fact that these are all sites where it had not previously been recorded, together with a late maturation time and often relatively inaccessible habitat, give a possibility of under-recording, hence downgraded to VU from EN. The main threat appears to be from changes in management practices or increase in browsing, leading to the loss of field layer vegetation. Threats: The clearance of scrub and old woodland for intensive forestry, and the removal of shrub layer vegetation.",
