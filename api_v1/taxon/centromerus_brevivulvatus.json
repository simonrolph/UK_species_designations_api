However, the true level of decline is uncertain since the wide range of habitats and few records suggest that the true microhabitat of this species has yet to be discovered, and hence it may be under-recorded and still present at some of these sites. EN is therefore proposed. Threats: The loss of heath through pine and bracken invasion is a problem at Blackdown. In 1976, large areas of heath at Iping Common were burnt, which may have reduced the amount of the preferred tall heather available to this spider for several years. Drainage for improved agriculture was a threat to the Insh Marshes, but this site is now an RSPB reserve.",
