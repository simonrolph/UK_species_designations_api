This is unlikely to be attributable to underrecording because, although identification of Araniella spp. requires critical microscopical examination, males at least have sufficiently distinctive coloration that they are likely to be recognised in the field by arachnologists. Threats: The loss of old yew and beech woodland and also of woods containing mature stands of these trees.",
