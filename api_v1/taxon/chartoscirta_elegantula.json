Described by Southwood & Leston (1959) as very local, it is a species that is apparently slow to colonise new sites (P. Kirby pers.comm.) and appears to be fairly exacting in its choice of sites (S. Moran pers. comm.). Like C. pilosus, C. elegantula is at its western limit in GB. It is Absent from France and Belgium and very scarce in Holland. The species was downgraded from Notable to Local as a result of the Welsh Peatland Invertebrate Survey WPIS) in the late 1980's during which it was 'found widely on Welsh wetlands' (Howe, 2004).  In view of the small number of recent records it is a species that does not fall far short of a threat status (AOO <2,000 km2), but given the WPIS findings a status of LC is appropriate.",
