            "comments": "C. sylvatica has been recorded from 20 hectads in the post-1980 period. In five of these hectads, surveys have established with reasonable confidence that the species is locally extinct, indeed from two of them the extinction probably occurred in the earlier period as the only post-1980 records are probably erroneous. C. sylvatica was reintroduced to one of these hectads (Iping Common, East Sussex) in 2007 and has been successfully re-established. It has also been successfully introduced to Brentmoor Heath, Surrey. Thus the best current estimate is that this species occurs in 16 hectads, with an AOO certainly less than 500 km2 (EN B2). C. sylvatica has been declining during the 1900s, as shown by the large negative Change Index of -1.82, and a large negative Raw Change (B2b i,ii,iv). It was recorded from 38 hectads in the earlier period, now reduced to 14, plus two other hectads to which it has been introduced. C. sylvatica would fit the criteria as an Endangered species under B2ab if it were a ëseverely fragmentedí species, by the IUCN definition of that term. A rigorous assessment of ësevere fragmentationí requires data on the size and viability of all populations, and data on the probability of gene flow between populations. Such data are not available even for C. sylvatica, one of the better studied species amongst Britainís rarer carabids. However, based on the best available data, the assessment by Scotty Dodd (in litt., March 2014) is that the Dorset metapopulation in six contiguous hectads is viable and with fairly good connectivity between many localities. However, in the remainder of the range, in Hampshire and Surrey, representing 10 of the 16 occupied hectads (62.5%), many populations are small, isolated by considerable distances and separated by land which is highly unsuitable for dispersal (urban areas, major roads, conifer plantations, secondary woodland). Even within heathland sites, a maximum dispersal distance of only 192 m was found by Dodd (2011a). Furthermore, the chronology of extinctions of C. sylvatica from former localities is clearly correlated with urban expansions and major road construction. Thus, there is reasonable evidence for an increased extinction risk from severe fragmentation of C. sylvatica populations in the past, present and future (B2a) and the species is assessed as Endangered.",
