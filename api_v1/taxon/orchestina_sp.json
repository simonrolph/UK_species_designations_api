Significantly, the quality of the habitat declined at this time when the ivy habitat was cut. Despite targeted searches, the absence of further records in over ten years suggests the population size reduction may be approaching 100%. Other potential sites with similar habitat have been searched, so far without success. There is no evidence that this spider has been introduced and is anything other than an extremely rare species which may now be extinct. Threats: The ivy was cut after 1994, and it is not known whether the habitat has been completely destroyed, or will recover.",
