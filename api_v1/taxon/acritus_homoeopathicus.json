However, it is certainly very restricted in distribution in Britain and efforts to find it are likely to be best-rewarded at 'new' sites within its known range. Data evidences a continuing decline. Application of IUCN Category A2 criteria to the last 30-year's of data gives an adjusted 10-year period decline of 45% which equates to designation as IUCN Category Vulnerable VUA2c With only three post-2000 records and only eight localities recorded for the species since 1990, a designation of IUCN VUB2a,b (ii)(iv) is also appropriate. 38 records.",
