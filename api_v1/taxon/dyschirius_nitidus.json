The aggregate of chalceus + nitidus meets the area requirements under criterion B2 for Endangered (AOO <500 km2) and Vulnerable (AOO <2,000 km2) and is declining. The aggregate is regarded as a habitat-specialist of relatively small, relatively isolated, early-successional, and often ephemeral, habitat patches which could expose it to an increased extinction risk. If there was good evidence to show that its range was severely fragmented and/or that it was undergoing extreme fluctuations, it would be assessed as Endangered. No formal assessment can be made at this stage of the segregate species but it is likely that both would be Threatened.",
