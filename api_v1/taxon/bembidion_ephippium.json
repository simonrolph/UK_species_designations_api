It is declining in EOO (if not also in AOO), with no post-1980 records from the south coast of England west of Lydd (TR01, East Kent). This is a habitat-specialist species occupying relatively small and relatively isolated habitat patches on the bare margins of saline and brackish lagoons, which could expose it to an increased extinction risk. If there was good evidence to show its range was severely fragmented, it would be assessed as Endangered.",
