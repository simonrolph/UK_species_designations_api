Specimens from the same site have subsequently been identified in two collections, one dating back to 1928, in which they were grouped with Saldula c-album. It seems likely that all the British records relate to this single site, where S. melanoscela has a long term provenance. The bug has been found on both banks of the river for a couple of hundred metres, mostly downstream of the bridge and in low numbers (Hewitt 2001). The River Wampool is tidal where S.  melanoscela occurs, with fine sandy mud flats backed by rough coastal grassland. As there is no immediate threat to the R. Wampool habitat (S. Hewitt pers. comm.), although a tidal barrage across the Solway Firth may be a future threat, S. melanoscela is designated VU on the basis of a single known location and an AOO of <10km2.",
