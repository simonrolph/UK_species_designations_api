The population size, range size, temporal trends and future prospects of Britain’s 58 terrestrial mammals are assessed. Island races and feral mammals are excluded from the main review. The objective of the review was to produce the most accurate assessment possible of population size, geographical range, and conservation trends since 1995.

Significant declines have been reported in many parts of the rabbit's European range, and it is inferred that declines approach 30% over the last 10 years overall. Consequently the species is assessed as Near Threatened (approaching A2b). In many countries outside Europe, the rabbit is an alien invasive species that is itself a threat to many other species; the listing of Near Threatened in Europe should not in any way deter efforts to eradicate the rabbit in areas where it is a conservation problem.",

A widespread colonizer and is considered a pest outside its natural range, where eradication of the rabbit is priority for conservation (Thompson and King 1994). However, only the natural range of Spain, Portugal, and northwestern Africa (Morocco and Algeria) are considered in this global assessment. O. cuniculus populations within the natural range have declined an estimated 95% since 1950, and 80% in Spain since 1975 (Delibes et al. 2000), due to disease, habitat loss, and human induced mortality (Ward 2005). These numbers are based on estimates from a protected area in Spain, Donana National Park, and the relative decline elsewhere in the range (Delibes et al. 2000). O. cuniculus nearly meets the Red List Criteria for Vulnerable under A2acde. There is no evidence that the decline has escalated in recent years, though threats remain and the decline is continuing.",
