A taxon is presumed extinct when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historical range have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time scale appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.",

With such old and limited data, it is difficult to assess the integrity of the species as indigenous, but for the purposes of this Review, it is considered a long-extinct native. 4 records.",
