Drainage of some New Forest bogs has been carried out in the past in order to increase the area and quality of grazing land. There is now very little grazing in Ashdown Forest, partly because the main roads crossing the unfenced common land are a danger to livestock. Consequently, scrub and bracken invasion of the heath is a problem.",
