In 1888 and 1974 it was found in Dorset in marshland, and in 2009 in Suffolk, in vegetation alongside a grazing marsh ditch. The Dorset site has changed and is considered no-longer suitable. The extreme rarity and exact ecological requirements of this species are not understood, either in this country or in Europe. Drainage and agricultural run-off are obvious threats which would result in a decline in habitat area and quality, and as a single population, it is vulnerable to stochastic events. Threats: Drainage and agricultural run off are threats to the marshland habitat which would result in a decline in area and quality. Over-grazing or poaching of ditch edge vegetion will result in habitat degradation.",
