            "comments": "The species was apparently fairly numerous at Shapwick Heath and Plaistow, Somerset, and Woodwalton Fen, but it has undergone a significant decline in AOO, with only two post-1993 records - from Woodwalton and from Ilton, Somerset (a single female).  Threats: Shapwick Heath has been very severely damaged by peat extraction, even within the National Nature Reserve, and only a small area of the wet heath remains. Although the original area may no longer exist, there are likely to be other similar areas there. Falling water tables due to agricultural drainage are a problem in the Somerset Levels sites and at Woodwalton Fen. It is difficult to maintain a high water table on the protected areas when the surrounding fields are being drained. The Great Fen Project aims to link up Woodwalton and Holme Fens, thus expanding and restoring the limited area of fenland in Huntingdonshire: several areas of arable have already been purchased.",
