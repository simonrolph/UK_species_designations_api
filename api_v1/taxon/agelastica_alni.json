            "designation_description": "A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

Although there are still few records, it seems to be expanding its range rapidly in NW England and has been found in Wales in 2013 (to be reported in The Coleopterist in 2014), hence the DD status with such a short time since rediscovery.",
