            "comments": "It could be argued that the 1876 example was not native to Britain, but to account for the presence of a non-pest species in Hornsey at that date would be difficult. Hammond (2007) comments that the recent finds constitute compelling evidence that it is an established British species. There appears to be a substantial breeding population at Windsor. Its apparently specialized habitat requirements, coupled with its highly reclusive habits are likely to make the species very difficult to find, lending some support to the view that it is a long-established but overlooked British species. Hammond (loc cit) concluded that it may be truly native. IUCN criteria satisfied are based on the very small or restricted population: geographic range restricted in area of occupancy (less than 3 tetrads) with severely fragmented populations (known from just 2 localities). No sub-fossil remains have yet been found in Britain (Buckland & Buckland, 2006), but current understanding suggests a long-term native.",
