Threats: Accidental fire or the too frequent use of fire as a management tool on the heathland habitat, and loss of habitat through changing land-use. A hundred hectares of Horton Common were ploughed up and turned over to agriculture in 1980. Birch and pine invasion is a threat on areas of heath, in the absence of burning, grazing or other active management. This is currently a problem in the spider's habitat on Chobham Common.",
