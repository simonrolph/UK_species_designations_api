Under criterion B2, the species is severely fragmented, and continuing decline is inferred in i) extent of occurrence, ii) area of occupancy, iii) quality of habitat, and iv) number of locations. Records tend to be of single specimens on particular individual trees, including dead hulks, and long-term viability of populations is questionable.",
