There appears to have been a contraction in range, with no records from Scotland since 1988. It is normally found in wet moss and litter in fens and wetwoodland where the main threats are drainage of fens and loss of wet, deciduous woodland through drainage or removal of trees. Threats: The most serious threat is from the drainage of fens and wet woodland.",
