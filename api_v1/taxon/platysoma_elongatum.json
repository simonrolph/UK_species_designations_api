A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",

It is not currently known whether the single specimen found is an adventive, an introduction, or a recent colonist. For the purposes of this review, a designation of DD is appropriate until further records or targeted surveys for the species can clarify its distribution and status. 1 record.",
