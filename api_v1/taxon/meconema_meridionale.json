However, it is also know to have arrived in the UK with horticultural imports. The effective colonisation of several parts of the UK is in accordance with the northward spread of this species in e.g. France, Netherlands, and effectively represents a continued expansion of its range. So it is not assessed, in accordance with IUCN guidance.",
