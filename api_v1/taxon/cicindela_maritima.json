It is certainly vulnerable to further contractions in EOO with just single outlying populations in West Norfolk and East Kent away from the core range on the west coast between North Devon and Merionethshire. It occupies similar habitat to Cicindela hybrida and faces similar vulnerabilities and threats (requiring robust protection of its remaining sites from development pressures and from coastal engineering, as well as ongoing sympathetic habitat management and management of recreational pressures). It is regarded as probably subject to severe fragmentation.",
