So, despite the species nearly qualifying for IUCN categorisation based on only 16 post 1990 hectads and a possible continuing decline, the author believes that it is probably under-recorded and with more recording effort, particularly in Wales and Scotland, it ought to be found to be more widespread than the current data suggests. Application of IUCN Category A criteria to the data using the pre- and post-1990 differential value of 68% decline gives, for an estimated 55 year period, an adjusted 10-year decline of 17% which is well below the 30+% threshold for designation as Vulnerable VUA2c. A new British Rarity designation of Nationally Scarce recognises this possibly continuing decline and the much fragmented nature of its distribution in our region. 96 records.",
