This is a Critically Endangered species but its true conservation status was obscured in the past by the preponderance of misidentified records. The author and others have made a significant effort to re-discover A. scitulum in recent decades, focusing on its Medway localities but also covering Chippenham Fen and the River Thames eyots (Peter Hammond, pers. comm.). Further survey efforts should continue to target the Medway sites and should also cover the stretch of natural Thames riverbank in the grounds of Syon House.",
