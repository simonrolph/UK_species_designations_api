            "comments": "Of the more widespread carabids, C. monilis has declined more than any other, with the lowest Change Index (-3.8) and a Raw Change of -63.4% based on the latest data, despite increased recording effort targeted at this species in recent decades (B2b ii, iv). There are records from 64 hectads in the post-1980 period, which, assuming an average occupancy of 4 km2 per hectad, gives a total AOO for the period of 256 km2 (EN B2), though with the continuing local extinctions during recent decades, the current AOO is likely to be much less than this (there are records from only 11 hectads during 2003-14). This is a flightless species which disperses on foot. The records are very scattered throughout the former range with most localities separated by tens of kilometres leading to a fragmented distribution. That many of the remaining populations are non-viable is clear (a) from the massive decline and (b) from the ongoing decline of all three populations which the author has revisited to conduct targeted monitoring. This fragmentation is here regarded as posing a severely increased extinction risk (B2a). C. monilis has a small world range in west central Europe (France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, extending marginally into northern Spain and northern Italy). It has been noted as a declining species in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland (Turin et al., 2003). The principal hypothesis for the substantial decline in this species across most of its world range is that increased mortality due to pesticide use has led to local extinctions (e.g., Turin et al. (2003)). As a large, long-lived species, which scavenges dead insects, slugs and snails in both the larval and adult stages, it is clearly likely to scavenge prey killed by insecticides and molluscicides throughout its life. The hypothesis is eminently plausible but remains untested. If this hypothesis is correct, further decline in and fragmentation of the range of C. monilis seems likely except on sites which are free from insecticide use and well buffered from adjacent land where insecticides are applied.",
