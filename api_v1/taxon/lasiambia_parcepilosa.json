It is based on text originally submitted in 1995, but subsequently updated a number of times, most recently in early 2016. It provides a valuable repository of information on many species and should act as a springboard to further survey and work.",

            "designation_description": "A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat or Lower Risk. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that a threatened category is appropriate.",
