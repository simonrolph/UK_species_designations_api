From reliably recorded specimens, the species appears to have a wider distribution than fimetarius and may also be more frequent than that species (pers obs.). A. pedellus is found across southern England, north to the Midlands and northern England, into Wales and also sparingly in mainland Scotland. Like fimetarius, it also inhabits the Outer Hebrides and the Ebudes. Interestingly, the distribution pattern suggests that the species might be more-or-less coastal north of Midlands England, but this may simply reflect recording bias.",
