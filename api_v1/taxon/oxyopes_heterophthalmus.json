            "comments": "While this species qualifies for EN on the basis of a restricted distribution and decline, most of the heathland sites at which it remains are protected, so the decline is likely to have slowed and VU is regarded as appropriate. However, the particular stage of heather it prefers is threatened by management prescriptions to reduce fire-rtisk (and is also vulnerbale to accidental fires), and at some sites insufficient management has resulted in habitat decline. Threats: Fire and loss of heathland habitat. Because of the increased fire risk that mature heather presents, heaths are often managed to avoid this phase, even on nature reserves. However, at Chobham Common, lack of management has resulted in birch and pine invasion. Accidental fires are also too frequent an occurrence on parts of this common, causing replacement of heath by Molinia caerulea. In parts of the New Forest, grazing by livestock prevents the heather developing into tall mature plants, but there are still areas of apparently suitable structure.",
