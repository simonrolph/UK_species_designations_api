With only 62 post-1990 hectads, the species would normally qualify for designation as Nationally Scarce (NR), but it is undoubtedly under-recorded in the region, particularly in Scotland where it should be widespread. Because it has a largely northern and western distribution, a designation of Nationally Scarce has not been awarded. 190 records.",
