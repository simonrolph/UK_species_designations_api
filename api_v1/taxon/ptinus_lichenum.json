The species appears to have always been a rarity apart from what appears to have been a substantial population in the London area in late 19th century, from the North Downs (Box Hill and Mickleham) northwards to Windsor Forest and Great Park, Highgate and Hainault Forest. The three most recent reports (one pre-1990) spread across much of its former British range. The main population reduction appears to have been in the distant past, but the Area of Occupancy is severely fragmented and continuing decline is apparent from the few modern records, none in the past 10 years, so a status of ‘Endangered’ appears clear.",
