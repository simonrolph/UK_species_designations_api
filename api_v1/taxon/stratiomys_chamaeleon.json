The area occupied is now very small, in three widely separated populations that allows little realistic chance of recolonisation should any of them go extinct. Four of the six hectads with recent records are on Anglesey but this is a misleading exaggeration of the area occupied; the separate fens span four hectads but lie within a block less than 0.35km2 in extent and the occupied habitat is considerably smaller than this. The habitat is scarce in Britain, and the Oxfordshire sites are also vulnerable to intensification of usage in surrounding arable farmland and settlements. Monitoring at Anglesey gives numbers of adults (sometimes larvae) in single figures and rarely as many as 75 individuals. A status of Endangered is clearly more appropriate than Vulnerable.",
