The spider is thought to have been fairly frequent in the past on wet areas of Hartland Moor and Morden Bog, Dorset. The catchment of Morden Bog was greatly modified by afforestion with conifers in the area last century. Historical records from the Cambridgeshire Fens are now in doubt. The last record at Wicken Fen, in 1977, is now considered incorrect and there is doubt over the Woodwalton Fen record. The record mapped in the Provisional Atlas for Chippenham Fen has not been substantiated. The lowering water tables, for example by drainage of adjacent land and/or water abstraction, would damage all the listed localities for this species. Threats: Lowering of the water table, such as by drainage of adjacent land and/or water abstraction, would damage all the listed localities of this species. A lower water table often leads to scrub invasion, which increases the drying process and shades out the fen and bog plant communities. The effects of drainage on the fenland sites are well known (e.g. Godwin 1978; Darby 1983). The catchment of Morden Bog has also been greatly modified by the extensive conifer forestry in the area this century.",
