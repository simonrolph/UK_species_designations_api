Water has been abstracted from Catfield Fen since 1986 and this has resulted in damaging changes in pH and water levels. As neighbouring fens are also affected this whole area constitutes one location (see IUCN guidelines). There are two other sites in East Norfolk (Burgh Common and Bure Marshes) that should be classed as additional locations. Records from the Pevensey levels all come from a fairly small area north east of Westham that constitute one location subject to threats of drainage, alien aquatic plants and sea-level rise. On the basis of a small known AOO (?40 km2), restricted number of locations (<5) and known threats to habitats (RSPB 2007, JNCC 2010 & other refs) H. gracilenta satisfies IUCN criteria for the status of  VU.",
