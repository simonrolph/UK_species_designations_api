It does not satisfy D2 as Vulnerable because of the number of recent locations (six), nor could it be considered to have a restricted population given the spread of the sites. The active pathogen threat in the form of Phytophthora alni attacking the tree supporting what looks like the principal larval food resource might operate as a plausible threat but this impact is, in itself, now restricted and of lesser concern than was formerly the case. Under B2a is satisfies both the number of locations and the fragmentation of those populations, and one can infer 20 declines under B2b iii & iv given the apparently restricted conditions of development in an annual fungus on a relatively short lived tree species with a linkage to streamside habitats across six very widely dispersed locations. Whilst not a clear case, given that the counts in the two period are equal, Vulnerable is suggested. This species would benefit from targeted rearing from alder bracket fungus Inonotus radiatus.",
