There is some indication from the two recent 15-year hectad counts that this decline is ongoing, with a further decrease of 25% in recorded hectads, but the four consecutive recent 10-year hectad counts negate this apparent trend. There are 21 locations since 1990, occupying 24 tetrads. Fifteen of these locations (71%) are in West Norfolk indicating that the British population is highly localised. Currently, the author believes that the species is not threatened, but agricultural improvements, development and land-use changes may impact in the long-term, resulting in its designation in future reviews. 87 records.",
