Found under stones in its cliff-top, maritime grassland habitat, difficulty of detection may, to some extent, limit our knowledge of its distribution. Threats: The cliff-tops at Kynance have suffered badly from heavy trampling, but public access is now controlled by the National Trust and the heath and grassland communities are recovering very well. Accidental fires are possibly the main threat at this site now. At Cadgwith there has been no grazing on the cliffs for many years and the coastal heath and grassland have been largely lost to rank vegetation including scrub and bracken. It is unlikely that G. occidentalis will have survived at Cadgwith.",
