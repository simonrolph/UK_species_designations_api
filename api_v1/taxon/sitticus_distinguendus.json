The two sites where it has been recorded, on either side of the Thames, are scheduled for development. A large proportion of the habitat at the Essex site, which is thought to hold over 90% of the British population, is undergoing development and the Kent site is going through the planning process. Although the species had not been identified in this country prior to 2003, the habitat where it has been found is comparable to that of European populations and the known population is almost certainly the result of natural colonisation of suitable habitat. Suitable habitat may be hard to come by in this country and it is the opinion of the global expert that this species has not been introduced.  Threats: Although first collected in Britain in 2003, the species is unlikely to have been overlooked, and known and potential sites are highly threatened by development in the near future.",
