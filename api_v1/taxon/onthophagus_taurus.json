            "comments": "Formerly rare in the region and only recorded in the database from the New Forest (Denny Bog SSSI) pre-1839. Jessop (1986) also cites Exmouth (pre-1867) and Oxford (pre-1841). A specimen in Leicestershire Museum collected by F.A.Hunter labelled 'O. verticornis Epping Forest 1 June 1951' is this species, but is believed, after research by the authors to be unreliable and erroneously labelled. A more recent record from the New Forest in 1967 (Allen, 2001) is unusual because the specimen was apparently overlooked for some 40 years in a collection. The provenance of this record should be investigated, but for now, the record is not accepted by the authors. Onthophagus taurus is present in the fossil record, but there is some uncertainty over the identification of the species – it could possibly be a closely related species illyricus Scopoli which is found in northern Europe (taurus has a more south European distribution) Ljunberg (2002).",
