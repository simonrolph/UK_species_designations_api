Elsewhere in Europe this is primarily thought to be a caverniculous species but our data do not support a strong association with caves. Its recorded association with smaller crevices in mines, cellars and stony debris may have resulted in some under-recording. Threats: Some cave systems in which it occurs may be threatened by quarrying.",
