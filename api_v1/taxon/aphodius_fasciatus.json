Hectad counts are of only 14 hectads for the pre-1990 period and 10 for the 2000-2015 period, but this is a localised northern and western species and the Midland/north England counties of Derbyshire, North Cheshire and Staffordshire are, like Scotland, relatively poorly recorded for this genus, Also, woodland dung beetles like fasciatus are generally less easy to locate than those which frequent open sites like pasture. Consequently, it is afforded Amber status only. Future targeted surveys for the species in the south Penines district would be desirable as would searches in previous occupied central Midland sites. A lack of grazing in woodland may be a contributory factor to any decline, should one be operating.",
