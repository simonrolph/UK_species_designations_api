However there has been some increase in AOO and evidence from bark trapping and unpublished surveys of semi-natural plantations show that this species is more widespread, and less dependent than formerly thought, on the core Caledonian pine areas.  However, it remains at risk from the effects of climate change and catastrophic damage to its habitat, for example by fire and recently introduced tree diseases. Threats: Previously under threat from the loss of Caledonian native pine forest through conversion to intensive plantation forestry, but such a threat can be considered to have reduced or ceased. Both Abernethy Forest and the Black Wood of Rannoch have suffered from planting of Scots pine and non-native conifers in large blocks, sometimes preceded by clear-felling of the native pine. However, Abernethy Forest is now owned and managed by the RSPB, and the restoration of native forest is a key aim.",
