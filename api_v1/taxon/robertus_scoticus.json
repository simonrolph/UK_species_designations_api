It is probably no longer present in the near-by Meggernie woods, its only other recorded location, where it has not been seen since 1965. Threats include climate change and catastrophic habitat damage by such agencies as fire and recently introduced tree diseases. Dense regeneration of pine would also affect suitable habitat.  Threats: Caledonian pine forests have been under threat from commercial forestry.",
