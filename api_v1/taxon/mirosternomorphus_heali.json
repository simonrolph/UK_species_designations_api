However, advice from the IUCN Global Species Programme (Caroline Pollock) is that a global assessment is only possible for species within their natural range, or outside their natural range if they have been translocated for conservation purposes. This seems an anomalous situation – that Red List status is dependent on human intention rather than actual threat - and the recommendation for this project remains ‘Near Threatened’.",
