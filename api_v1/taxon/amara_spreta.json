It is a rather under-recorded species but with no evidence of decline. Recent discoveries from 2008 in two hectads in Merionethshire represent a significant range extension but it is more likely overlooked there than actually expanding. Its requirement for early-successional habitat could mean it is vulnerable to extreme fluctuations in number of localities.",
