The habitat in one of the post-1980 hectads (Flixton Sand Pit) has been destroyed. There is good evidence for a continuing decline, with no records from coastal sites north of The Wash since a 1985 record from Cayton Bay (one of the sites where a targeted survey for N. livida in 2006 drew a blank (Telfer, 2006b)). In Norfolk, since 2000 there have been records from West Runton, Overstrand and between Sidestrand and Trimingham (Telfer, 2006a). The habitat of this species is also considered to be threatened by coastal engineering to prevent erosion in some localities, by the risk of increased erosion rates caused in other localities, by changing hydrology (referring to the water feeding the seepages on the cliff face), and from inappropriate land use inland of the eroding cliff face.",
