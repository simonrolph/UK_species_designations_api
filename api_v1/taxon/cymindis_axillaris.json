There is clear evidence of a decline in AOO (though seemingly without a corresponding decrease in EOO). The decline in AOO seems to be continuing into the modern period since the Ground Beetle Recording Scheme database currently only holds post-2000 records for Landguard Point and two localities on the Isle of Portland. It is near to the 'Number of locations' threshold for Vulnerable (B2a) and thus Near Threatened.",
