Due to the uncertainty of the species' status in the region, the widely-spaced localities with sporadic records only and to the possibility of it being overlooked, a designation of DD may be considered appropriate. However, the species is undeniably rare currently and was historically also considered a real rarity. The populations are also fragmented in terms of their spatial distribution. Accounting for these facts, the populations could be impacted by threats such as the felling and clearance of plantations. Hence, a designation of IUCN Category VUD2 is appropriate. 12+ records.",
