It has not been recorded in West Sussex since 1952, Suffolk since 1972, or Dorset since 1979. It has been collected from just two locations since 1993, and exhibits a substantial decline. Threats: The loss of semi-natural dry grassland to intensive farming, either arable or livestock, will have contributed to a decline in the habitat available for this species. Conversely, the neglect of suitable habitat and the decline in rabbit-grazing, with ensuing invasion by scrub or bracken, is also likely to have been damaging.",
