            "comments": "Despite recent surveys of historic and other suitable sites for this species, it is known from only four sites in three hectads (though one of these was in 2014 and therefore is not shown in the table), and decline appears genuine. As a species predominantly associated with veteran trees its distribution is highly restricted and sites are isolated. Lack of temporal continuity of such trees is a threat to its future. Threats: All the British sites from which this species is known are SSSIs and Sherwood Forest is a Country Park where the conservation importance of over-mature trees is fully recognised. Threats include the loss of ancient woodland to other land-uses such as intensive forestry and agriculture, and the removal of over-mature trees from existing ancient woods and parks. For much of the twentieth century, ancient pollard trees were removed in Epping Forest out of a mistaken belief that woodlands should be vigorous. These ancient pollards form favoured sites for birds' nests and squirrel dreys which appear to be especially attractive to M. midas. Further loss was caused by the wind throw of top-heavy pollarded hornbeams during the hurricane of 1987, a result of the discontinuation of active pollarding in the forest after World War II. In Windsor Forest, large areas of the ancient woodland were converted to intensive conifer production in the 1940s and 1950s with concomitant loss of ancient trees. Current use of much of this forest for public recreation brings the threat of removal of ancient trees for safety reasons. The single remaining oak in Donington Park where this species is known to occur is no more than a stump, following extensive wind damage.",
