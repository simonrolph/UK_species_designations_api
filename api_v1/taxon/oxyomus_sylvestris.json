The species is often found in association with garden grass and compost heaps and like other species that occupy this habitat (e.g. the rove beetle Philonthus jurgans), it is likely to be under recorded (pers obs) so the total of 35 post-1990 hectads probably greatly under-estimates its true current distribution. For this reason, it is not considered Nationally Scarce even though the hectad count falls below the upper limit of 100 for this category.",
