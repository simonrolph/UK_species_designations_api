Threats: Areas of Caledonian pine forest are threatened with conversion to intensive forestry using Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis, lodgepole pine Pinus contorta and other alien species. It is unlikely that conversion of open Caledonian pine forest to dense plantation forestry will maintain habitat in a suitable state for this species. The forest at Abernethy is an RSPB reserve which is managed to maintain the native pine forest and its special communities.",
