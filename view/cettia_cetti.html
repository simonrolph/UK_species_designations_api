   <td style="text-align:left;"> The first formal Red List Category for birds based on IUCN criteria and guidelines. This assessment (No 34 in the Species Status series) is not an alternative to BoCC and does not replace or supersede it. It is recommended to use the BoCC status as the starting point for identifying which birds are most deserving of conservation action.  This assessment focusses on regular breeding and over-wintering birds of Great Britain, thus excluding birds in the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and northern Ireland. It includes 289 species and 68 subspecies on the British list and excludes non-natives, vagrants and scarce migrants. For species that have substantial and at least partially distinct breeding and non-breeding populations in GB (defined as having a population in the non-breeding season that is more than twice the size of the breeding population), notably waterbirds, the breeding and wintering populations are assessed separately. Therefore a species is assigned an IUCN Red List category for its breeding and wintering populations. Some notable bird subspecies, all of those for which Britain is of international importance, i.e. more than 20% of the northwest European flyway (wildfowl), East Atlantic flyway (waders) or European (all others) population were also assessed. These are national assessments determining the status of birds in Great Britain, however influences at regional level have also been considered if there is significant immigration of individuals from outside GB likely to breed which could rescue populations from extinction. For non-breeding taxa the assessment considers if conditions both inside and outside the region are deteriorating. Subsequently 22 species have been downgraded to consider this contribution. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The status of breeding Cetti’s Warbler was assessed as being of Least Concern in Great Britain. The population trend does not appear to approach the thresholds for Near Threatened under the population trend criterion (&gt;20% decline over ten years or three generations). The species has an large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Near Threatened under the range size criterion (EoO &lt;30,000 km2, AoO &lt;3,000 km2). The population size is within the thresholds for Near Threatened under the population size criterion (&lt;15,000 mature individuals); however, the species does not show a continuing decline of at least 10% in three generations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Protected Birds, Animals and Plants are listed in Schedules 1, 5 and 8 respectively of the Wildlife and Countryside Act.Schedule 1. The Act makes it an offence (with exception to species listed in Schedule 2) to intentionally kill, injure or take any wild bird or their eggs or nests. Special penalties are available for offences related to birds listed on Schedule 1, for which there are additional offences of disturbing these birds at their nests, or their dependent young. Schedule 5. The Act makes it an offence (subject to exceptions) to intentionally kill, injure, or take, possess, or trade in any wild animal listed in Schedule 5, and prohibits interference with places used for shelter or protection, or intentionally disturbing animals occupying such places. The Act also prohibits certain methods of killing, injuring, or taking wild animals.Schedule 8. The Act makes it an offence (subject to exceptions) to pick, uproot, trade in, or possess (for the purposes of trade) any wild plant listed in Schedule 8, and prohibits the unauthorised intentional uprooting of such plants.There is a statutory five-yearly review of Schedules 5 and 8 (protected wild animals and plants respectively). </td>
